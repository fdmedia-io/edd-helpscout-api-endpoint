# EDD HelpScout API Endpoint

This class optimizes the existing endpoint for the [EDD HelpScout](https://github.com/webzunft/edd-helpscout) add-on. It dramatically increases the performance of all (remote) API requests.

Results depend on many factors (active plugins, ..) but it is not unusual to experience a 50% gain in speed and a decrease in memory consumption of about 25-30%.

### Usage

1. Add the plugin file to your `/wp-content/mu-plugins` folder of the site running Easy Digital Downloads & EDD HelpScout.
1. Everything else will be done automatically by the EDD HelpScout add-on.
